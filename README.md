# Banking---Conversations-

# Objective:

Develop a Context-aware Ai Chat bot using Transformer Models for Banking support.

# KEY FEATURES:

* Understands customer queries.

* Retrieves relevant banking information.

* Responds in Natural Language.

* Handles multiple intents amd entities.

Tech stack:

* Python, Hugging face transformers, pytorch.

* Dataset:50k labeled banking conversations.

* tools; jupyter notebook, cuda-enabled GPU.

# DATA PREPRATION AND PREPROCESSING:

1) dataset cleaning:

* Removed null entries, special characters, and duplicates.

* Lowercased all Text.

2) Tokenization:

* Used bert tokenizer, applied padding and truncation.

3) INTENT AND ENTITY MAPPING:

* Mapped intents to labels ,used spacy for entities.

* For unknow intents we used Logistic Regression to Classify the intent

# MODEL BUILDING AND FINE - TUNING.

 Model used:
 
 Bert: used for classifying user intents.

 Gpt-2 : utilized for generating responses.

 Roberta: Applied for intent classification.

 Distilbert: Leveraged for identifying user intents.

 Commom Errors:
 
 * CUDA outof Memory

 * Incorrect Label Court

 # EVALUATION AND METRICS:                 Common Errors:

  * Intent: Accuracy, F1-score             * Label Mismatch During Evaluation
 
  * Entities: Precision ,Recall            * Tokenization Inconsistency.
 
  * Response: BLEU Score, Coherence
 
   * Latency: Response Time Measurement

   KEY TAKEAWAYS AND FUTURE WORK 

   Lessons Leamed:

   Ensure Consistent Preprocessing
   
   Transformers Need GPU for Efficiency.

   Higging Face Eases Model Usage.

   Future Improvements :

   * Add RAG for Better Retrieval.

   * Multilingual Support

  * Improve Latency with Quantization.

   Final Thought :

   * Transformers Enable Scalable , smart Banking Support.
